# Spotify_Alexa_Integration (WIP)

This is a POC (proof of concept) project that investigates integrating Alexa to manage your Spotify music library. 

Phase 1 - simply explores adding new songs that you have discovered and like to your 'liked songs' list

Phase 2 - Will implement adding songs to specific playlists (not yet built)

# Steps to run project

1. Clone the repository

2. Run pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Move into the spotify-service/alexa_spotify_app directory

4. Run 'py manage.py runserver'

5. Once the server has started, open the URl provided by the result of the command execution

6. Authorise the app to manage your Spotify music library by clicking the authorise button and logging in when prompted

7. You are now good to go! 

NOTE: This is still in testing phase so the app has not yet been published as a commercial alexa skill which can be used on your own personal Alexa device
